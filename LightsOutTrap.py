"""This module gives the infrastructure for representing graphs, labeled graphs,
and groups, mainly for the study of the "Lights Out" games.  Vertices
are represented by integers starting at zero.  Edges are represented either by
dictionaries stored in "vert_dict" (where the keys are the vertices and the values
are a list of vertices adjacent to the key) or ordered pairs stored in "edge_set",
which correspond to the two vertices in the edge.  Later, when we want to study
multigraphs, we will let them be triples whose third component is the number of
edges between the two vertices.  We will also have to figure out how to store
multiple edges in the edge dictionary.  Labels are represented by integers
that are either integers modulo some integer k or integers representing group
elements as described below.  It also includes a boolean variable "win" that
tells us if the "Lights Out" game has been won.

Groups are represented by integers starting at zero.  The group structure is
stored in a Cayley table (matrix)."""
